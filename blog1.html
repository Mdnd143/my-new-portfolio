        <h1 class="section2">mai nahi karunga How to introduce yourself</h1>
        <h3 class="section3">When we see someone give the most engaging, impressive and rapport-building introduction,
            we immediately think they’re gifted.

            But in reality, there’s usually a lot of work behind it.

            When writing your sample introduction in English, ask yourself: Who exactly am I talking to? Depending on
            your answer, there will be different things to include in your introduction.

            So, what makes an introduction effective? First, it needs to be appropriate for the given setting.

            Consider, is it a formal or an informal situation?

            Because you know that saying “Hey there! How’s it going?” is perfectly okay if you’re with a group of
            friends, but of course, it might come across a bit odd in a meeting with your boss. So knowing the context
            is important.

            Let’s look at some ways you could introduce yourself in English based on different situations. </h3>
            <h2 class="section2">How to Best Introduce Yourself at a Job Interview</h2>
            <h3 class="section3">You’re sitting in a reception area, dressed in a carefully chosen outfit. You’re showered and polished. Your hair is perfect. Your hands are manicured. Now, if only your palms would stop sweating!
            Few things are quite as unnerving as job interviews. You approach them knowing that unless you match the employer’s expectations you’re not going to land that sweet gig. Fortunately, there are plenty of things you can do to ensure you’ll make a good impression when the stakes are high.</h3>
            <h2 class="section2">Introduce yourself in a professional way</h2>
            <h3 class="section3">First impressions start here, so make sure you get it right. Your next career move could well begin with a hello and a handshake. In the reception area, introduce yourself.
            The single best thing you can do to ace an interview is to conduct some research ahead of time. Learn as much as you can about the company you’re interviewing with. Visit their website and look for things like a careers or culture page. Scan their social media accounts to get a feel for their brand voice. Visit Glassdoor to see what employees are saying about them, which might give you more culture clues as well as insight into their strengths and challenges. When you’re armed with information, you’ll feel less vulnerable, and when the time comes, you’ll be able to demonstrate your insight into the company.
